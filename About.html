      “Owners of dogs will have noticed that,<br />
      if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection,
      <br />they will think you are god. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to
      realize that,<br />
      if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection,<br />
      they draw the conclusion that they are gods.”
